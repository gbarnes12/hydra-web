		<p>
			If you haven't an account yet but you really want to test this awesome password system, click the 
			"Register an account" link just below the login field where your email adress goes. 
			Type your email adress - make sure it's correct! (Don't worry, this part is just for demonstration purposes, we aren't
			a bit interested in your personal information) </br>
			Click the green square button that says "go" - this type of button is usually what brings you further along
			on this site. </br>
			Now you can view a number of pretty pictures we carefully selected for you to use. Grab the one you want, depending on 
			your personal taste or your present mood. Or if you don't care, just pick the monkey, what the hell.
			Now it is time to select your points. Choose carefully, you will be expected to remember these for the login! 
			What we need from you is to set 5 points by clicking, no more and especially not any less! </br>
			We will let you know when everything is okay and you are ready to go play with the login.

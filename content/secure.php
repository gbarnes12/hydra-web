<h1>Welcome to YAAPPS.</h1>
<br /><br />

<h4>What is this all about?</h4>

<p>
Remembering your boring password can be difficult. <br />
yaapps (yet another awesome picture password system) is an easy and fun way to sign in. <br />
And in case we didn’t mention this yet: it’s awesome! <br /><br />
- <strong>Visit yaapps.net</strong>, <br />
- <strong>select your username</strong> and <br />
- <strong>go pick your damn points</strong>.
</p>

<h4>Awesome! Is there any source?</h4>

<p>
<strong>YES!</strong> Indeed there is. Since this is only a project which was built throughout<br />
a course at FH-Düsseldorf, Germany. We'd like to share the source to the public and welcome<br /> 
you on board.<br /><br />
We would appreciate it if you decide to use the source code to further develop this way of signing into websites and<br />
make it more popular all over the world wide web.<br /><br />

- <strong>Go to http://code.google.com/p/hydra-web/</strong>, <br />
- <strong>grab the source with SVN</strong> and <br />
- <strong>start integrating it into your website.</strong>.
</p>

<h4>What do I need to get this running?</h4>

<p>
You need at least a web server with PHP (version 5) and MySQL running. <br />
You should know how to use a Database and work with FTP programmes.<br />
<br />
Once downloaded you want to
create a new database with some name you'd like to have. <br /> 
Afterwards browse to the <strong>yaapps</strong> folder in our project and open the <strong>config.php</strong><br />
In the file you want to set the necessary parameters of your database (host, username, password, database).<br />
<br />
Fire up phpMyAdmin or whatever database administration tool you're using. Grab the dump file of our database within<br />
the database folder in our project files and copy / paste the sql code into your database administration software.<br />
Create the new tables with the sql code.
<br /><br />
Now you can go and upload the files to your webspace and try if everything works out perfectly.
